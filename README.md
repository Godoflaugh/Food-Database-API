  ## Elevator Pitch
  Every single human being on this planet must do two things in order to continue living on this earth. That is eating and drinking.  We can't escape it, its the very lifeblood of our species. Well over here at the newly formed DSKP Inc.. we want to keep you alive but more importantly we want it to be tasty and for you to be able to share your discoveries with the world! With our finest software engineers at hand we have created a product to make you the next top foodenceur. We call it "Foodz Pleaze". This is a fully interactable web application that allows you to submit your creations online to a multitude of other home chefs who will be able to comment, like, and review your recipes. Using a live database the application will store all of the data for repeated access. The creator will be able to submit, edit, and remove their creations at the click of a button. So get to those kitchens and cutting boards and start sharing your deliciousness with the world!
